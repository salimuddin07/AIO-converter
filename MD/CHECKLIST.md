## üìã What You Need to Do Now

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Immediate Actions (Required)

#### Install Dependencies
```powershell
# In the project root directory:

# Install root dependencies (including Electron)
npm install

# Install all workspace dependencies
npm run install:all
```
**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started

---

#### Create Application Icons

**Required files:**
- `build/icon.ico` - Windows icon file
- `build/icon.png` - 512x512 PNG source

   - Or use the placeholder generator: `node scripts/generate-icon.js`

2. **Convert to ICO**
   - Use online tool: https://icoconvert.com/
   - Or ImageMagick: `magick convert icon.png -define icon:auto-resize=256,128,64,48,32,16 icon.ico`

3. **Place files:**
   ```powershell
   # Copy files to correct locations
   copy your-icon.png build\icon.png
   copy your-icon.png public\icon.png
   copy your-icon.ico build\icon.ico
   ```

**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started  
**See**: `build/ICON_README.md` for detailed instructions

#### Test in Development Mode

```powershell
# Option 1: Quick test (use batch file)
.\dev-electron.bat

# Option 2: Manual test
# Terminal 1:
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2:
npm run dev:electron
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Window opens correctly
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Backend server starts
- [ ] All features work

**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started

.\build-windows.bat

# Or manually
npm run build:win
```

**Expected output** (in `dist/` folder):
- `AIO Converter-1.0.0-x64.exe` - Windows installer
- `win-unpacked/` - Unpacked application files

**Status**: ‚¨ú Not started

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Installer

**On your development machine:**
1. Run the installer: `dist\AIO Converter-1.0.0-x64.exe`
2. Follow installation wizard
3. Launch the installed app
4. Test all features

**On a clean test machine** (recommended):
1. Use a VM or different PC (Windows 10/11)
