## 🔧 WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

### You Said:
> "i am not seeing any thing in my app...it was showing the blank page"

### The Issues Were:
1. **Vite build used absolute paths** (`/assets/`) - Doesn't work with `file://` protocol
2. **Frontend expected HTTP backend** - Was trying to connect to `localhost:3003`
3. **No Electron bridge** - Frontend didn't know how to use Electron IPC

### The Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ **Changed `frontend/vite.config.js`** - Added `base: './'` for relative paths
2. ✅ **Created `frontend/src/utils/electronBridge.js`** - Auto-detects Electron and uses IPC
3. ✅ **Updated `frontend/src/main.jsx`** - Added startup logging
4. ✅ **Rebuilt frontend** - With correct configuration
5. ✅ **Repackaged app** - New version 1.0.1 with all fixes
