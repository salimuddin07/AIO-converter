# Video Splitting Preview/Download Issue - Investigation Summary

## Issue Identified:
You're not seeing preview and download options after video splitting in the Electron app.

## Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Video splitting is working** - logs show 60 segments created successfully
2. **Backend processing is correct** - segments are generated with proper file paths  
3. **Issue is in the frontend display** - SplitResults component not showing video previews

## Possible Causes:
1. **File:// URL restrictions** - Electron might block file:// URLs in video elements for security
2. **Missing result data** - Response structure mismatch between Electron and browser modes
3. **URL resolution issues** - File paths not converting correctly to displayable URLs

## Debugging Steps Added:
1. Added console logging to GifSplitter component to see received data
2. Added console logging to SplitResults to see normalized items
3. Added console logging to Electron backend to see returned result structure

## Immediate Solutions to Test:

### Option 1: Test with Browser Mode
- Start the backend server: `npm run start:backend`  
- Open browser to `http://localhost:3003`
- Test video splitting there to confirm if issue is Electron-specific

### Option 2: Check Console Logs
- Open DevTools in Electron app (Ctrl+Shift+I)
- Look for the debug logs we added:
  - "üîç Split result received:"
  - "üîç Items extracted:"
  - "üîç SplitResults received:"

### Option 3: Manual File Access
- Check if segments exist in the temp folder
- Try opening segment files manually to confirm they're valid

## Expected Debug Output:
When you run video splitting now, you should see detailed logs showing:
1. The raw response from Electron API
2. How items are extracted
3. How URLs are normalized
4. Whether SplitResults receives the data properly

This will help pinpoint exactly where the preview/download options are getting lost.
