# Testing Video Split Issues - LATEST FIXES

## Issues Being Fixed:
1. **Missing audio in video segments** - Fixed FFmpeg commands to preserve audio properly
2. **Missing preview/download UI** - Added extensive debugging to track data flow
3. **File access security** - Temporarily disabled web security for local file access

## Changes Made:

### 1. Audio Preservation Fix
- Changed FFmpeg from `-c copy` to `-c:v copy -c:a aac`
- This ensures video is copied without re-encoding but audio is properly encoded to AAC for compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Debugging & File Access
- Added comprehensive logging in both Electron backend and React frontend
- Added visual indicator when no results are found
- Enhanced URL resolution debugging with detailed console logs
- Added video load event handlers to track loading issues
- **Temporarily disabled webSecurity in Electron** to allow local file:// access

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added video error event handlers
- Enhanced path resolution logging
- Better segment data validation

## Testing Steps:
1. **Open the app** (should already be running)
2. **Open Developer Tools**: Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I
3. **Go to Console tab** to see debug logs
4. **Try splitting a video**:
   - Upload a video file with audio
   - Set segment duration (e.g., 30 seconds)
   - Click "Split video"
5. **Check console logs** - Look for:
   - `üîç Split result received:` - Shows backend data
   - `üîç Setting split data with type:` - Shows frontend processing
   - `üîç Rendering SplitResults with:` - Shows UI rendering
   - `üîç SplitResults received:` - Shows component receiving data
   - `üîç Normalized item X:` - Shows URL processing

## Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Video segments should have audio
- ‚úÖ Preview videos should appear in the UI  
- ‚úÖ Download buttons should be available
- ‚úÖ Console should show successful data flow

## If Still Not Working:
- Check console for any error messages
- Look for red error text in the console
- Verify files are being created in temp directory
- Report specific console errors for further debugging
