# Quick Frontend Update Script

# After you get your Render backend URL, run these commands:

# 1. Update the environment file
# Replace 'YOUR_ACTUAL_RENDER_URL' with your real URL
$backendUrl = "https://gif-converter-backend-XXXX.onrender.com"

# Update the .env.production file
$envFile = "frontend/.env.production"
$content = @"
# Production environment - self-managed backend
# Replace this value with the HTTPS URL of your deployed backend API.
# Example: If your Render app is named 'gif-converter-backend', use:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://gif-converter-backend.onrender.com
# 
# IMPORTANT: This MUST be an HTTPS URL for Vercel deployment to work
VITE_BACKEND_URL=$backendUrl
