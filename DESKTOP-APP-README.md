- **IPC Communication:** Renderer ↔ Main process via secure IPC channels

- **Processing Libraries:**
  - Sharp for image conversion
  - FFmpeg for video processing
  - No external APIs or cloud services

### Main Files

- `package.json` - App configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App won't start?
1. Make sure you're running `AIO Converter.exe` from the full folder (not just the exe)
2. Check Windows Defender didn't quarantine it
3. Run as Administrator if needed

### Features not working?
- **Image conversion:** Sharp library is bundled (should work)
- **Video conversion:** FFmpeg is included in the Electron build
- **File dialogs:** Native Windows dialogs used

### Still having issues?
Check the dev console in the app:
1. Launch the app
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open DevTools
3. Check the Console tab for errors

3. **Share with others** - ZIP the folder and share!
4. **Create installer** - Use NSIS for professional distribution
